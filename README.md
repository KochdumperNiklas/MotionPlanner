# Installation
We recommend to create a Anaconda environment for running the code:

  `conda create --name commonRoad python=3.8`
  
  `conda activate commonRoad`

The required python packages can be installed with pip:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
Finally, the motion planner can be executed by running the main file:

  `python3 main.py`
